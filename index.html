<h2>Object of the Game</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The object of the empire game is to bring peace to the galaxy during a time of great strife as the old imperial dynasty falls into ruin and chaos and all the imperial houses rush to fill the power vacuum. </li>
		<li>The game lasts for six months at one turn a week or 24 turns. The game will start on XX August 2020 and end on XX March 2020. We will take a week off for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years. </li>
		<li>Each turn represents a season or four months of game time. The entire game will cover 8 years, from IC 2180 to IC 2188.</li>
	</ul>
<p>At the end of the game points will be awarded thusly:<p>
	<ul>
		<li>20 points to anyone who is a member of a house which controls the majority of territory. Allied houses count each other’s territory as part of their own. </li>
		<li>10 points to any individual who is the empress or emperor of the majority held territory.</li>
		<li>Tie breaker: -1 point to each member of a House for every commander or officer death suffered. </li>
	</ul>
<h2>Turn Order</h2>

	</ol>
<h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>No communication with players outside your House about the game.</strong> Communication is a huge part of the game. If you want to make contact with another house, send a messenger, diplomat, or spy. Or defect.</li>
		<li><strong>This is a competitive game</strong> with a huge potential for failure, betrayal, death, and loss (we hope). As such we ask that you all <strong>be good sports</strong> and get into the spirit of the game, and compete passionately but without crossing any personal lines by becoming mean spirited or emotionally abusive. </li>
		<li>If you have an in person problem with another player that you can sort out as adults, contact the referees. </li>
