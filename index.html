<h2>How to Play</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>The object of the game</strong> is to bring peace to the galaxy during a time of strife as the reigning imperial dynasty falls and all the formerly loyal noble houses rush to fill the power vacuum. </li>
		<li><strong>The game lasts for six months</strong> of real time at one <strong>turn</strong> a week or 24 turns.
    <li>Each <strong>turn</strong> represents a season or four months of game time. The entire game will cover 8 years, from IC 2180 to IC 2188.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The game will start on XX August 2020 and end on XX March 2020.</li>
        <li>We will take a week off for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Players are each members of a <strong>House</strong> which is made up of a <strong>Commander</strong> and several subordinate <strong>Officers</strong>.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commanders</strong> are the publically known leaders of their respective <strong>Houses</strong>. They receive <strong>scenarios</strong> from the Referees each week and issue orders to their <strong>Officers</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Officers</strong> report to the Commander of their house. Each week they tell the Referees what actions they'd like to take.</strong></li>
      </ul>
    <li><strong>The Referees</strong> will not know what orders were issued to the Officers, only what actions the Officers take. Similarly, the Commanders won't know what actions their officers took, and the Offices won't know what scenarios were shared with the Commanders.</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Turn Order</h3>
Each week, turns will proceed as below. The <a href="./news.html">News</a> will be updated as events become public.
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Scenarios</strong> are emailed to the Commanders each Sunday night by 11:59pm CST. Referees will make any meta-game announcements at the same time.
      <ul>
        <li>Commanders ask the referees questions about the scenarios</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
		<li><strong>Commanders</strong> deliberate with their house, brief their officers and <strong>issue orders via email to their officers.</strong> </li>
		<li><strong>Officers</strong> consider their approach and <strong>transmit their final actions via email to the referees no later than Wednesday evening at 11:59pm CST.</strong> </li>
		<li>Late actions will have a negative effect on the success chance of the action. </li>
		<li>Orders that do not arrive by Thursday at 8am CST will cause the officer to be <strong>MIA.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Referees</strong> collect final actions, deliberate, rule on the outcome of each action, and <strong>generate new scenarios.</strong></li>
	</ol>
<h3>Scoring</h3>
<p>At the end of the game points will be awarded:<p>
	<ul>
		<li>20 points to anyone who is a member of a house which controls the majority of territory. Allied houses count each other’s territory as part of their own. </li>
		<li>10 points to any individual who is the empress or emperor of the majority held territory.</li>
		<li>Tie breaker: -1 point to each member of a House for every commander or officer death suffered. </li>
	</ul>
<h3>Sporting Conduct</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>This is a highly competitive game</strong> with a huge potential for failure, betrayal, deception, and loss. As such we ask that you all <strong>be good sports</strong>, get into the spirit of the game, and compete passionately without crossing any personal lines, becoming mean spirited, or emotionally abusive. </li>
		<li>If you have a problem with another player that you can resolve, please contact the referees.</li>
